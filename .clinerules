# ADDITIONAL IMPORTANT RULES

## **⚠️ CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS ⚠️**

- Before completing work you must run `make lint` to check for any linting errors.
- Whenever adding new features you must always create accompanying unit tests.
- After completing the tasks the user has requested you MUST run the tests (`make test`) to ensure they all pass. If any tests fail, you MUST fix them before proceeding.

## Installing and connecting to the package-version MCP server

- When you are ready to build and run the mcp server to call its functions simply do a `make` - this will build the application and it will be automatically madeavailable to you so you can call its tools / functions directly. No need to run the server manually or stop and ask the user to do so.
