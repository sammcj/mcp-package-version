# TESTING

- **⚠️ CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS - Whenever adding new features you must always create accompanying unit tests.**
- **⚠️ CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS - After completing the tasks the user has requested you MUST run the tests (`make test`) to ensure they all pass. If any tests fail, you MUST fix them before proceeding. ⚠️**
- **⚠️ CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS - When you are ready to run the mcp server to call its functions, do a make - this will build the application and automatically make it available to you so you can call its tools.**
